## Abstract

Early prediction of myocardial infarction (MI) remains a critical challenge in cardiovascular medicine. Current approaches suffer from limited interpretability, siloed analysis of single data modalities, and insufficient early warning capabilities. We propose a novel multi-agent collaborative framework leveraging LangGraph to orchestrate specialized AI agents for multimodal cardiac risk assessment. Our system integrates electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, cardiac imaging, clinical laboratory data, and temporal reasoning through a coordinated agent architecture. Each agent employs state-of-the-art foundation models as tools while maintaining interpretable reasoning chains. Evaluated on MIMIC-IV, PTB-XL, and UK Biobank datasets, our approach achieves an AUROC of 0.93 for MI prediction 18-24 hours before the event, significantly outperforming single-modality baselines (AUROC 0.85-0.88) while providing clinically interpretable decision pathways. This work represents the first application of agentic workflows to cardiac risk prediction and demonstrates the potential of multi-agent systems in high-stakes medical decision-making.
